*bisect.txt*  Plugin for navigation via bisection.

This plugin will allow you to reach a desired location on the visible screen by
performing a sequence of bisections to the left, right, up, and down.

For example, suppose your cursor is above the desired location on the screen.  Call
the BisectDown command, and your cursor will move halfway between its current
location and the bottom of the screen.  Now suppose your cursor is below the desired
position.  Call the BisectUp command, and your cursor will move to halfway between
its current position and its original position.  Repeat as necessary.  BisectLeft and
BisectRight work analagously.  Horizontal and vertical commands can be interleaved. 

The VisualBisect commands work exactly like the normal Bisect commands in visual
mode.

Please note that a bisection does not currently end until the cursor moves away from
the last position that resulted from a bisection.  Even if the cursor moves away and
comes back, the previous bisection will not terminate.  You can manually terminate a
bisection by invoking <Plug>StopBisect and <Plug>VisualStopBisect, in normal and
visual modes, respectively.  There are no default key mappings for the stop bisect
commands, so you may want to map them yourself if you find yourself needing them
frequently.
