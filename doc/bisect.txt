*bisect.txt*  Plugin for navigation via bisection.

This plugin will allow you to reach a desired location on the visible screen by
performing a sequence of bisections to the left, right, up, and down.  By
default, these are performed using the <C-h>, <C-l>, <C-j>, and <C-k> commands,
respectively.

For example, suppose your cursor is above the desired location on the screen.
Call the BisectDown command, and your cursor will move halfway between its
current location and the bottom of the screen.  Now suppose your cursor is
below the desired position.  Call the BisectUp command, and your cursor will
move to halfway between its current position and its original position.  Repeat
as necessary.  BisectLeft and BisectRight work analagously.  Horizontal and
vertical commands can be interleaved. 

The VisualBisect commands work exactly like the normal Bisect commands in
visual mode.

You do not need to completely finish a bisection before resuming normal
editing.  A hybrid approach is often faster.

Please note that a bisection does not currently end until the cursor moves away
from the last position that resulted from a bisection.  Even if the cursor
moves away and comes back, the previous bisection will not terminate.  You can
manually terminate a bisection by invoking <Plug>StopBisect and
<Plug>VisualStopBisect, in normal and visual modes, respectively.  There
default key mapping for stop bisect is <C-n>.

Also note that this script uses the 's and 'p registers and that this behavior
is not currently configurable.  The `p command can be used to return to the
last bisection result in order to continue the previous bisection, assuming one
of the StopBisect commands has not been called.

Here's an example .vimrc snippet that should use <C-m> for StopBisect as
opposed to the default, <C-n>:

nmap <C-m> <Plug>StopBisect
xmap <C-m> <Plug>VisualStopBisect

And here's another example for using the arrow keys instead of h, j, k, and l.

nmap <C-Left>  <Plug>BisectLeft
nmap <C-Right> <Plug>BisectRight
nmap <C-Up>    <Plug>BisectUp
nmap <C-Down>  <Plug>BisectDown
xmap <C-Left>  <Plug>VisualBisectLeft
xmap <C-Right> <Plug>VisualBisectRight
xmap <C-Up>    <Plug>VisualBisectUp
xmap <C-Down>  <Plug>VisualBisectDown


Normal Mode Mappings:
<C-j>  or  <Plug>BisectDown
    Perform a downward bisection.
<C-k>  or  <Plug>BisectUp
    Perform an upward bisection.
<C-h>  or  <Plug>BisectLeft
    Perform a leftward bisection.
<C-l>  or  <Plug>BisectRight
    Perform a rightward bisection.
<C-n>  or  <Plug>StopBisect
    Manually terminate the last bisection.

Visual Mode Mappings:
<C-j>  or  <Plug>VisualBisectDown
    Perform a downward visual bisection.
<C-k>  or  <Plug>VisualBisectUp
    Perform an upward visual bisection.
<C-h>  or  <Plug>VisualBisectLeft
    Perform a leftward visual bisection.
<C-l>  or  <Plug>VisualBisectRight
    Perform a rightward visual bisection.
<C-n>  or  <Plug>VisualStopBisect
    Manually terminate the last bisection from visual mode.

Registers Used:
's
    Point where selection started before last visual bisection
'p
    Result of last bisection.
